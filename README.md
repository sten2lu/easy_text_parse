# Easy Twitter-Filter
This Code Repository should allow for a cheap and easy way to parse through a dataframe like structure consisting of some text. Initially the dataframe is parsed with some regex pattern and the findings can then be filtered by hand via the command line interface. 

Wish you all the best!
